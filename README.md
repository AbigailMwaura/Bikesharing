# Bikesharing

## Overview of the statistical analysis

This statistical assignment requires using public data from the Citi Bike bikeshare program in NYC and Tableau to connvice investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, IA is a good business proposal. To achieve results, we will use tableau to show a breakdown of the gender bike's  users which is an important step for developing the business idea

## Results

The visualization shows how most bike rides are under 20minutes in total duration, and the peak hours are in the morning and evening during commute hours. This would allow the early morning or late evening to be used for bike maintenance.

The graph above skews heavily on male usage, but as we will learn the graph actually balances and the usage is the same for both male and female users

## Summary
If the program was to be introduced in Des Moines, it would fare really well due to the receptive usage. Weekday users would be those commuting to work and weekend users would be tourists or 'for fun riders'. The usage is skewed towards male users, but there are opportunities to increase engagement for both male and female users.
